# Persistent Storage

In this exercise, you will learn how to persist the filesystem state of your containers using
dynamic volume provisioning.

## Learning Goals

- How to attach a volume to a container in a pod
- How to use dynamic volume provisioning to create persistent block storage to save the
  state of your applications
- How to create PersistentVolumes and use them with PersistentVolumeClaims

## Introduction

Kubernetes, a persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is a way for a
pod to request a specific amount of storage from the cluster. When a PVC is created, it is
automatically bound to a persistent volume (PV) that satisfies the PVC's requirements.

A storage class (SC) is a way to define the properties of a PV. It is a blueprint for creating PVs,
and it specifies things like the type of storage, the amount of storage, and the access modes for
the PV. The cluster then uses the storage class to find or create a PV that matches the PVC's
requirements.

In summary:

- PVs are the actual storage resources in the cluster
- PVCs are requests for storage made by users
- SCs are the specifications for creating PVs.

## Exercise

### Overview

- Observe that the state of the PostgreSQL database is not persisted between pod lifecycles
- Inspect the Available StorageClasses (sc) of the cluster
- Create a PersistentVolume (PV) using dynamic volume provisioning
- Consume the PersistentVolume using a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and mount the volume to a pod
- Delete the pod with the volume attached and observe that the state is persisted when a new pod is created

### Observe that the state of the PostgreSQL database is not persisted between pod lifecycles

Deploy the manifests located in `persistent-storage/start`

> :bulb: If you have resources already deployed from a previous exercise, you might want to clean
> them up first.

- Open the frontend webpage in your browser.
- Observe that the frontend reports that it is connected to the database.
- Add some quotes. We will need them later to test persistence
- Retrieve all of the quotes, and observe that your quotes are part of the retrieved quotes.
- Now delete the postgres pod using `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`
- In the frontend webpage, retrieve quotes, and observe that you now only get the default 5 quotes
  from the database.

What we have observed here is that the state of our database is not persisted between pod lifecycles!
To fix this, we need to persist the filesystem state of our database container to a `volume`.

### Inspect the Available StorageClasses (sc) of the cluster

Use `kubectl` to get the available `StorageClasses` in the cluster, the shortname for `StorageClass`
is `sc`:

```shell
kubectl get StorageClasses
```

Expected output:

```shell
NAME   PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
gp2    kubernetes.io/aws-ebs   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  3h43m
gp3    ebs.csi.aws.com         Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  3h29m
```

We see that we indeed have a `StorageClass` available and ready for use!

<details>

<summary>:bulb: What do the columns mean?</summary>

The output of the `kubectl get sc` command provides some useful information about the StorageClass:

- `PROVISIONER` The underlying storage provider, in this case `AWS EBS` (Elastic Block Storage)
- `RECLAIMPOLICY` What will happen with the volume when the `PersistentVolume` resource is deleted,
  in this case `Delete` will delete the block storage.
- `VOLUMEBINDINGMODE` specifies how to provision the actual volume, `WaitForFirstConsumer` will
  provision the actual volume object once there is a matching claim.
- `ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION` defines whether a volume can be expanded in size at a later point in time.

</details>

### Create a PersistentVolume (PV) using dynamic volume provisioning

Let's create a `PersistentVolume` (PV)!

While we could create a manifest for a `PersistentVolume` manually, we will not do that in this exercise.

In practice, we will almost always create a `PersistentVolume` by creating a `PersistentVolumeClaim`,
which uses a `StorageClass` to create the actual volume.

Create a new file `persistent-storage/start/postgres-pvc.yaml`

Copy and paste the below boilerplate yaml to the new file:

```yaml
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
  name:
spec:
  storageClassName:
  accessModes:
    -
  resources:
    requests:
      storage:
```

Next we fill in the values:

- The `apiVersion` should be `v1`
- The `kind` is `PersistentVolumeClaim`
- The `metadata.name` should be `postgres-pvc`
- From the previous section, we know that we have one or two `StorageClass` available, so we should
  choose one of them. "gp3" is faster and cheaper than "gp2" in AWS, so let's go with that by
  setting `spec.storageClassName` to `"gp3"` (with quotes)
- The `spec.accessModes` list should contain one item with the value `ReadWriteOnce`
- the `spec.resources.requests.storage` is the size of the volume in Gibibytes (Gi), set it to `5Gi`

<details>
<summary>The finished manifest should look like this</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: "gp3"
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

</details>

Apply your new `PersistentVolumeClaim` with `kubectl apply`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f persistent-storage/start/postgres-pvc.yaml
```

Expected output:

```text
persistentvolumeclaim/postgres-pvc created
```

Check that the `PersistentVolumeClaim` was created using `kubectl get`:

```shell
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim
```

Expected output:

```text
NAME           STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
postgres-pvc   Pending                                      gp3            3m19s
```

Check if a `PersistentVolume` was created using `kubectl get`:

```shell
kubectl get persistentvolume
```

Expected output

```text
No resources found
```

> :bulb: `PersistentVolumes` objects are `cluster-wide`, ie, "not-namespaced", so you might see
> `PersistentVolumes` belonging to other users.

We expect that a PersistentVolume has not been created _yet._

As we can see in the `kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim` output above, our `PersistentVolumeClaim`
is in the `Pending` status.

This is because the `VOLUMEBINDINGMODE` of the StorageClass is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`, as we
saw in the previous section.

`WaitForFirstConsumer` will not create the actual volume object until it is used by a pod.

> :bulb: The reason you might not want to always create volumes as soon as `pvc` objects are
> created is to reduce costs, by not creating resources that are not used before they are attached
> to a pod.

Let's attach the PersistentVolumeClaim to our postgres pod!

### Consume the PersistentVolume using a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and mount the volume to a pod

Open the postgres deployment manifest in your text editor `persistent-storage/start/postgres-deployment.yaml`.

In the `spec.template.spec` add the following section:

```yaml
    ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name:
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName:
      ...
```

Add the values to the snippet:

- `spec.template.spec.volumes[0].name` is the name we will reference when we mount the volume to a
  container in a moment. Set it to `postgres-pvc`.
- `spec.template.spec.volumes[0].persistentVolumeClaim.claimName` is the `name` of the
  `PersistentVolumeClaim` we have created above, set it to the name you used, e.g., `postgres-pvc`.

> :bulb: In this case, the volume name and reference to the `pvc` name are the same; this is
> coincidental, and they can be different.

<details>
<summary>How the finished manifest should look</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  template:
    metadata:
      ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: postgres-pvc # name we can reference below in container
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: postgres-pvc # name of the actual pvc
      containers:
      ...
```

</details>

Next, we mount the volume we have defined to the postgres container:

In the deployment manifest file, add the following section to the postgres container spec, e.g., `spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts`

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name:
    mountPath:
    subPath:
```

Fill in the values:

- `name` should be the name we specified above when we declared the available volumes.
  In this case, this should be `postgres-pvc`
- `mountPath` is the path in the container to mount the volume to. For postgres, the database state is
  stored to the path `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- `subPath` should be `postgres`, and specifies a directory to be created within the volume. We need
  this because of a quirk with combining `AWS EBS` with Postgres. (If you are curious, why:

      containers:

              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
              subPath: postgres
```

</details>

Apply the changes to the PostgreSQL deployment using `kubectl apply`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f persistent-storage/start/postgres-deployment
```

Expected output:

```text
deployment.apps/postgres configured
```

Observe that the `PersistentVolume` is now created:

```shell
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes
```

Expected output:

### Delete pod with volume attached and observe that state is persisted when a new pod is created

Now that the state of our PostgreSQL database is persisted to the volume, let's verify:

- Open the frontend webpage and add some quotes
- Retrieve quotes from the database, and observe that your quotes are among them
- Delete the database pod with `kubectl delete pod <postgres-pod-name>`
- Wait for the postgres pod to be recreated (you can watch for pod changes with `kubectl get pods --watch`)
- In the frontend webpage, retrieve quotes and observe that your quotes are among them

</details>

### Clean up

Delete all resources created using `kubectl delete -f <manifest-files>`

```shell
kubectl delete -f persistent-storage/start
```
