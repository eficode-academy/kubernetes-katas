# Service Discovery and Loadbalancing


## Accessing a service:

To access any service inside any given pod (e.g. nginx web service), we need to *expose* the related deployment as a *service*. We have three main ways of exposing the deployment , or in other words, we have three ways to define a *service* , which we can access in three different ways. A service is (normally) created on top of an existing deployment.

### Service type: ClusterIP
Expose the deployment as a service - type=ClusterIP:
```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type ClusterIP
service "nginx" exposed
```

Check the list of services:
```
$ kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   2d
nginx        ClusterIP   100.70.204.237   <none>        80/TCP    4s
```

Notice, there are two services listed here. The first one is named **kubernetes**, which is the default service created (automatically) when a kubernetes cluster is created for the first time. It does not have any EXTERNAL-IP. This service is not our focus right now.

The service in focus is nginx, which does not have any external IP, nor does it say anything about any other ports except 80/TCP. This means it is not accessible over internet, but we can still access it from within cluster using the service IP, not the pod IP. Lets see if we can access this service from our multitool.

```
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$ kubectl exec -it multitool-5c8676565d-n9rvz bash
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# curl -s 100.70.204.237 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# 
```

It worked! 

But there's more...we can also access the nginx using dns:

```
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# curl -s nginx | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[root@multitool-3148954972-k8q06 /]# 
```

Now log out of the bash on the multi-tool pod by type `ctrl+d` to get out of the pod.

You can use the `describe` command to describe any Kubernetes object in more detail. e.g. we use `describe` to see more details about our nginx service:

```
$ kubectl describe service nginx
Name:              nginx
Namespace:         default
Labels:            app=nginx
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          app=nginx
Type:              ClusterIP
IP:                100.70.204.237
Port:              <unset>  80/TCP
TargetPort:        80/TCP
Endpoints:         100.96.1.148:80
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

You can of-course use `... describe pod ...` , ` ... describe deployment ...` , etc.


**Additional notes about the Cluster-IP:**
* The IPs assigned to services as Cluster-IP are from a different Kubernetes network called *Service Network*, which is a completely different network altogether. i.e. it is not connected (nor related) to pod-network or the infrastructure network. Technically it is actually not a real network per-se; it is a labeling system, which is used by Kube-proxy on each node to setup correct iptables rules. (This is an advanced topic, and not our focus right now).
* No matter what type of service you choose while *exposing* your deployment, Cluster-IP is always assigned to that particular service.
* Every service has end-points, which point to the actual pods serving as a backends of a particular service.
* As soon as a service is created, and is assigned a Cluster-IP, an entry is made in Kubernetes' internal DNS against that service, with this service name and the Cluster-IP. e.g. `nginx.default.svc.cluster.local` would point to `100.70.204.237` . 


### Service type: NodePort

Our nginx service is still not reachable from outside, so now we re-create this service as NodePort.

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1       <none>        443/TCP   17h
nginx        ClusterIP   100.70.204.237   <none>        80/TCP    15m
```

```
$ kubectl delete svc nginx
service "nginx" deleted
```

```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type NodePort
service "nginx" exposed
```

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        NodePort    100.65.29.172  <none>        80:32593/TCP   8s
```

Notice that we still don't have an external IP, but we now have an extra port `32593` for this pod. This port is a **NodePort** exposed on the worker nodes. So now, if we know the IP of our nodes, we can access this nginx service from the internet. First, we find the public IP of the nodes:
```
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                                            STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION        EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE                             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
gke-dcn-cluster-35-default-pool-dacbcf6d-3918   Ready     <none>    17h       v1.8.8-gke.0   35.205.22.139   Container-Optimized OS from Google   4.4.111+         docker://17.3.2
gke-dcn-cluster-35-default-pool-dacbcf6d-c87z   Ready     <none>    17h       v1.8.8-gke.0   35.187.90.36    Container-Optimized OS from Google   4.4.111+         docker://17.3.2
```

Even though we have only one pod (and two worker nodes), we can access any of the node with this port, and it will eventually be routed to our pod. So, lets try to access it from our local work computer:

```
$ curl -s 35.205.22.139:32593 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
```

It works!

### Service type: LoadBalancer
So far so good; but, we do not expect the users to know the IP addresses of our worker nodes. It is not a flexible way of doing things. So we re-create the service as `type=LoadBalancer`. The type LoadBalancer is only available for use, if your k8s cluster is setup in any of the public cloud providers, GCE, AWS, etc.

```
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$ kubectl delete svc nginx
service "nginx" deleted
```

```
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
service "nginx" exposed
```

```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        LoadBalancer   100.69.15.89   <pending>     80:31354/TCP   5s
```

In few minutes of time the external IP will have some value instead of the word 'pending' . 
```
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      100.64.0.1     <none>        443/TCP        17h
nginx        LoadBalancer   100.69.15.89   35.205.60.29  80:31354/TCP   5s

```

Now, we can access this service without using any special port numbers:
```
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$ curl -s 35.205.60.29 | grep h1
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
[demo@kworkhorse exercises]$
```

**Additional notes about LoadBalancer:**
* A service defined as LoadBalancer will still have some high-range port number assigned to it's main service port, just like NodePort. This has a clever purpose, but is an advance topic and is not our focus at this point.


# High Availability:

So far we have seen pods, deployments and services. We have also seen Kubernetes keeping up it's promise of resilience. Now we see how we can have **high availability** on Kubernetes. The easiest and preferred way to do this is by having multiple replicas for a deployment.


Lets increase the number of replicas of our nginx deployment to four(4):
```
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4
deployment "nginx" scaled
```

Check the deployment and pods:
```
$ kubectl get deployments
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
multitool   1         1         1            1           24m
nginx       4         4         4            4           34m
```

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
multitool-3148954972-k8q06   1/1       Running   0          24m
nginx-569477d6d8-4msf8       1/1       Running   0          20m
nginx-569477d6d8-bv77k       1/1       Running   0          34s
nginx-569477d6d8-s6lsn       1/1       Running   0          34s
nginx-569477d6d8-v8srx       1/1       Running   0          35s
```

**Notice:** The nginx deployment says Desired=4, Current=4, Available=4. And the pods also show the same. There are now 4 nginx pods running; one of them was already running (being older), and the other three are started just now.


You can also scale down! - e.g. to 2:

```
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=2
deployment "nginx" scaled
```

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
multitool-3148954972-k8q06   1/1       Running       0          25m
nginx-569477d6d8-4msf8       1/1       Running       0          21m
nginx-569477d6d8-bv77k       0/1       Terminating   0          1m
nginx-569477d6d8-s6lsn       0/1       Terminating   0          1m
nginx-569477d6d8-v8srx       1/1       Running       0          2m
```

Notice that unnecessary pods are killed immediately.

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
multitool-3148954972-k8q06   1/1       Running   0          26m
nginx-569477d6d8-4msf8       1/1       Running   0          22m
nginx-569477d6d8-v8srx       1/1       Running   0          2m
```

You can delete the nginx deployment and service at this point. We have no use for these anymore. Besides, you can always re-create them.

```
$ kubectl delete deployment nginx

$ kubectl delete service nginx
```

## Extra-credit: High Availability Exercise
To prove that multiple pods of the same deployment provide high availability, we do a small exercise. To visualize it, we need to run a small web server which could return us some uniqe content when we access it. We will use our trusted multitool for it. Lets run it as a separate deployment and access it from our local computer.

```
$ kubectl run customnginx --image=praqma/network-multitool --replicas=4
deployment "customnginx" created
```

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
customnginx-3557040084-1z489   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-c6skw   1/1       Running   0          49s
customnginx-3557040084-fw1t3   1/1       Running   0          49s
```

Lets create a service for this deployment as a type=LoadBalancer: 

```
$ kubectl expose deployment customnginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer 
service "customnginx" exposed
```

Verify the service and note the public IP address:
```
$ kubectl get services
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)        AGE
customnginx   LoadBalancer   100.67.40.4   35.205.60.41       80:30087/TCP   1m
kubernetes    ClusterIP      100.64.0.1    <none>             443/TCP        17h
```

Query the service, so we know it works as expected:
```
$ curl -s 35.205.60.41 | grep IP
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
```

Next, setup a small bash loop on your local computer to curl this IP address, and get it's IP address.
```
$ while true; do sleep 1; curl -s 35.205.60.41; done
Container IP: 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
^C
```

We see that when we query the LoadBalancer IP, it is giving us result/content from all four containers. None of the curl commands is timed out. Now, if we kill three out of four pods, the service should still respond, without timing out. We let the loop run in a separate terminal, and kill three pods of this deployment from another terminal. 

```
$ kubectl delete pod customnginx-3557040084-1z489 customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt customnginx-3557040084-c6skw 
pod "customnginx-3557040084-1z489" deleted
pod "customnginx-3557040084-3hhlt" deleted
pod "customnginx-3557040084-c6skw" deleted
```

Immediately check the other terminal for any failed curl commands or timeouts. 
```
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.149 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.149 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.150 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.36 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.37 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.2.38 <BR></p>
Container IP: 100.96.1.151 <BR></p>
```

We notice that no curl command failed, and actually we have started seeing new IPs. Why is that? It is because, as soon as the pods are deleted, the deployment sees that it's desired state is four pods, and there is only one running, so it immediately starts three more to reach that desired state. And, while the pods are in process of starting, one surviving pod takes the traffic.

```
[kamran@kworkhorse kubernetes-katas]$ kubectl get pods
NAME                           READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE

[kamran@kworkhorse kubernetes-katas]$ 
```
This proves, Kubernets provides us High Availability, using multiple replicas of a pod.
